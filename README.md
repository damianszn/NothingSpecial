# Nothing Special
is a small website i did to remind myself of Javascript !

I use different API's to output random shows, jokes and animals (for now) :

```
let things = {
    anime: `https://api.jikan.moe/v3/anime/`,
    joke: `https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke`,
    show: 'http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/',
    cat: `https://aws.random.cat/meow`,
    dog: `https://random.dog/woof.json`
};
```
